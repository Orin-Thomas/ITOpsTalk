# Welcome

Hello Folks!

Have you ever had a deployment blocked because the behavior you get from the portal is different than the deployment you get from an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template or a Bicep deployment?  Well, I had that issue for a little internal project I was working on.  Let me tell you how I resolved it using built-in Bicep functionality.

As you may know Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources.  It provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse.  And as far as Iâ€™m concerned, the authoring experience is far superior to writing ARM templates.

## Scenario

Here is an example scenario. When using the portal to deploy a Key Vault. You can assign an access policy and give yourself access to get/list/set/delete/recover/backup/restore secrets.

But when you deploy any resource in Azure using a Bicep file the identity of the user\service principal executing the deployment is NOT exposed to the deployment environment.

So, to resolve this,  I used a Deployment Script, a User Assigned Identities and a role assignment.  Basically, in my Bicep deployment file I create a User Assigned Identities, assign the adequate role to that identity so it can execute the Deployment Script and get the result I am looking for.  That result is the ObjectID of the user or Service Principal that initiated the deployment.  One I have the ObjectID i can assign the Access Policy I need to the Key Vault.

Here is a sample Bicep file illustrating the process I used.
